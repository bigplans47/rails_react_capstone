20+ action items post Epicodus

Summary of goals: My top goal tend to focus on getting out to networking events and meeting people face to face as it is better to know people and then hear about work through the grapevine then apply to jobs without knowing people. My mid-level goals are more focused on preparing for formal interviews and learning in-demand technologies. My low priority goals are nice to haves that focus on getting experience with specific parts of technologies that I have overall experience with.
